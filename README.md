A quick script to merge my mp3 files

I am a big fan of audiobooks, but the problem with many of them is that they tend to be split into ~50 different parts each. This becomes a problem when I want to upload them to, say, a player, or another device that cannot open a zip archive. 

This script solves that. Using the ffmpeg tool for Linux (and maybe other platforms, if they have a version of the command line tool) this short script takes all mp3 files in the directory and merges them together into 4 parts. This way, they are much more convenient to transport and read for me. 

This script is quite basic and not that pretty, but I was not trying to make it amazing and went for speed. Program has built-in documentation with -h command option.
